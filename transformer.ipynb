Instead of assigning a probability of 1.0 to the correct class and 0.0 to all others, label smoothing assigns a small amount of probability to incorrect classes. This can make the model more robust and improve generalization. In other words, label smoothing hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\n",
