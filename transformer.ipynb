You see in Figure 1 that Add and Norm is applied after (Post-LN) the transformation (Multi-Head Attention). But now it is more common to apply LayerNorm before (Pre-LN) the transformation, so there is a reshuffling of the Layer Norm. This is called pre-norm formulation and that is the one we are going to implement as well."

Instead of assigning a probability of 1.0 to the correct class and 0.0 to all others, label smoothing assigns a small amount of probability to incorrect classes.
